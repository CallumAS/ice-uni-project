# Project
For course context i decided on developing a web application using an unfamiliar stack. I liked this idea and explored a simplistic version using a different language 8 months ago and i did want to make a more professional level application for my portfolio.

i did have experience with the relevant APIs and understanding the required control flow for the project however i thought this was fair since I consciously decided to avoid languages, frameworks and technologies I was well acquainted with to introducing me to knew challenges.
