# ice-uni-project

Selected the project idea, language and framework using random wheel so its not my normal stack or a stack im used too.

This project i have done before however it was 7 months ago and i did it while exploring different stacks so i kind of know what to do but not in the language; the framework is the same but vue is not my main framework i much prefer svelte so even though there is a lot of similarities i intend to do it from scratch and use a different backend language

project            - crypto widgets 
language           - rust
frontend framework - vue
Start Time         - Sat 16 Dec
Finish Time        - N/A(trying to speed run)
